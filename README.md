## Part 2

- The visualization that I picked is a bar chart that represents the homelessness and poverty in rich countries, including United Kingdom, United States, Italy, Belgium, Germany. https://ourworldindata.org/homelessness-and-poverty-in-rich-countries

- The reason for selecting this chart is my curiosity about the homelessness rate in developed nations, and the data’s clarity and simplicity make it easy to comprehend.


- **First visualization using Python3, pandas, and matplotlib**
    - Visualizing the data as shown in the screenshot using pandas, Python3, and matplotlib is proving to be more challenging than anticipated. Creating a basic bar chart is relatively easy, but modifying the chart to be horizontal, adding labels to the bars, and changing the units of the x-axis requires more effort. While I have successfully made the bar chart horizontal and added labels to the bars, I am still struggling to modify the units of the x-axis.

- **[Using Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-WNWkSrpVATzABkzVeRmRA1WnXrjOnmN2mZd7rbDcYc/edit#gid=663744370)**
  - Although I was initially unfamiliar with Google Sheets, I found that using it to create a graph was relatively easy and straightforward compared to other methods. In fact, using Google Sheets made the graph creation process faster and more efficient. With the help of Google Sheets, I was able to create a graph that closely resembles the screenshot shown above with less efforts.

- **[GUI visualization tool, Flourish](https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/13208634/)**
  - Flourish offers many options for creating and customizing graphs. However, as a beginner, I found the interface overwhelming. Although the platform appears to be user-friendly, I struggled to navigate and find the features I needed, such as labeling the x-axis as a percentage and adding labels to the bars. It is possible that these features are not available on the tool or were difficult for me to locate as a novice user.

- **Reflection**: The easiest is probably using matplotlib library as I have pre-exisitng knowledge of it. However, if I am new to all those tools, I would say Flourish seems to be the easiest to learn to use. The most customizable in my opinion is Flourish and the best tool for analysis is the combination of pandas, numpy, and matplotlib as i have freedom to modify the data, adding new columns, normalizing it, etc so I can analyze it more freely and easily. The best for communication is again Flourish and the visualization that they provide is very nice and beautiful

## Part 3: 

  - Which data you have requested, as well as the status of that data (i.e., did it arrive? did you get a confirmation email? etc.)
    - Apple Health Data - **status:** arrived
    - Google Calendar - **status**: arrived
    - Youtube & Youtube Music - **status**: arrived (the file is very large 1.4gb)
